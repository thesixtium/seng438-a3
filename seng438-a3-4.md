# 1 Introduction

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Text…

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Method: expand

After:

The (lower > upper) condition was never true with the old tests, thus a test was added where this condition was true to achieve 100% coverage on this unit test.

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

EclEmma:
- Very easy to use and intuitive
- Had all coverage metrics easily accessible
- Came pre-installed

Branch:
- Helped determine if all if/else branches were covered
- Can be hard to achieve 100% coverage

Statement:
- Easy to determine if 100% code coverage was achieved
- Doesn't indicate correctness, just if lines were ran

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

Requirements-Based Testing
- Pinpoints bugs by focusing on known functionalities
- Risk of redundant, time-consuming tests with little value

Coverage-Based Testing
- Ensures a clear requirement for number of tests
- Provides a measurable metric to gauge testing completeness

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab
